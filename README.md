SynergyQuest is a 2D top-down cooperative multiplayer action-adventure video
game.
It entertains 2-4 players by letting them delve into dungeon levels
filled with a variety of puzzle challenges, mini-games, and battle sequences.

What is special about this game is that players use their smartphones as
controllers. The game runs locally on a PC and serves a web-page to which the
players can connect with their phones. Using touch controls and sensor input
(accelerometer etc.) they can control their game character.
