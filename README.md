# Synergy Quest - A Mobile-Controlled Cooperative Multiplayer Game

SynergyQuest is a 2D top-down cooperative multiplayer action-adventure video
game.
It entertains 2-4 players by letting them delve into dungeon levels
filled with a variety of puzzle challenges, mini-games, and battle sequences.

What is special about this game is that players use their smartphones as
controllers. The game runs locally on a PC and serves a web-page to which the
players can connect with their phones. Using touch controls and sensor input
(accelerometer etc.) they can control their game character.

For detailed information on the game and the development process, see the
technical report (distributed on the `Releases` page of this repository).
