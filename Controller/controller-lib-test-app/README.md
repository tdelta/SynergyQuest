This app serves as an example on how to use `../controller-client-lib` in a
react app.
See `src/App.tsx`.

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

First, build the client library (`controller-client-lib` project).
You might also need to rebuild the library if it has been changed by a commit.

Now you can install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
You should also run the Unity game at the same time.
