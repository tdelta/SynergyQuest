This react web app serves as a testing ground for [../sensor-input-lib](../sensor-input-lib).
It is not necessarily kept up to date with the library and really only intended for experiments
so it may break occasionally.

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
See `src/App.tsx` for the main application code.

## Usage

Build [../sensor-input-lib](../sensor-input-lib) beforehand.

```sh
yarn install
yarn upgrade ../sensor-input-lib
yarn start
```
